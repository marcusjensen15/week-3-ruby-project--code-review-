## Description

_The user is able to add, edit, delete, and revise projects for their volunteering org. Additionally, they are able to add volunteers and associate them with a given project. The user is able to add and view each volunteer and project individually. _

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repo from Github_
* _Install the latest version of Ruby on your computer_
* _Make sure your Gemfile contains the following gems: ('sinatra'),'rspec','pry', ('sinatra-contrib')
 ,'capybara'_
* _Make sure to bundle all gems once you have added them_
* _Create a database called 'volunteer_tracker' with Tables titled projects and volunteers inside. your project table should have (title varchar, and id serial PRIMARY KEY) as values for each row. Your volunteers table should have (name varchar, project_id intiger, and id serial PRIMARY KEY) as each column value. Create another database off of this template called 'volunteer_tracker_test'. It is critical that you use these exact naming conventions because the app references them constantly in the code_
